Workflow and Functionality:
General Information Retrieval:

The utility seems to provide information about the system.
The help option provides assistance or information about using the utility.
The cpu getinfo option retrieves CPU-related information.
User Management:

The create USERNAME option creates a new user with the specified username.
File Information Retrieval:

Several options are provided to retrieve information about files:
--last-modified: Gets the last modification time of a file.
--owner: Gets the owner of a file.
--permissions: Gets the permissions of a file.
--size: Gets the size of a file.
User Privileges:

The --sudo-only option retrieves users with sudo privileges.
Application Architecture:
The internsctl utility is likely implemented using a shell script (test.sh). Here's a basic breakdown of how the application might be structured:

Command-Line Argument Parsing:

The script (test.sh) would start by parsing command-line arguments to determine the user's intention.
Option Handling:

Different code blocks or functions would be invoked based on the specified options.
For example, if the user provides help, the utility would display information about how to use it.
If the user provides cpu getinfo, it would retrieve and display CPU information.
For file-related options, it might use system commands or custom logic to fetch the required information.
User Management:

If the create option is provided, the script would create a new user with the specified username.
Output Formatting:

The script would format the retrieved information and print it to the console.
