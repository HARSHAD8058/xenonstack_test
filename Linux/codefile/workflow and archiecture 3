Workflow and Application Architecture:
The provided Bash script appears to be a command-line utility that performs various system-related tasks. Here's a breakdown of the workflow and application architecture:

Command-Line Argument Parsing:

The script starts by checking if the number of command-line arguments is at least 1. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
If the argument count is valid, it proceeds to check the specific commands or options.
Version and Help Options:

If the command is --version, it prints the version information.
If the command is --help, it prints a set of available commands and their descriptions.
Basic Commands:

The script handles basic commands related to CPU and memory information.
For the cpu command, it uses the lscpu command to retrieve CPU information.
For the memory command, it uses the free command to retrieve memory information.
Intermediate Commands - User Management:

The script checks for the user command and handles user-related operations.
For user creation (create), it uses the useradd command.
For listing users, it uses the /etc/passwd file and optionally filters for users with sudo permissions.
Advanced Commands - File Operations:

The script checks for the file command and handles file-related operations.
It checks for options like --permissions, --size, --owner, and --last-modified (or their short forms -p, -s, -o, -m).
It uses various commands (ls, stat, etc.) to retrieve and display file information based on the provided options.
